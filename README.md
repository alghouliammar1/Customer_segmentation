**Customer Classification Based on Purchasing Behavior**

This project, titled **Project A**, leveraged my skills in **Unsupervised Machine Learning** to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior over a specific period. The primary goal was to analyze and segment customers into distinct groups to better understand their buying patterns, which can inform targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and improved customer engagement.

### Key Components of the Project:

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:

    -   Gathered customer transaction data, including purchase history, frequency, and spending amounts.

    -   Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

    -   Conducted EDA to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in customer behavior.

    -   Visualized data using tools like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights.

3.  **Unsupervised Learning Techniques**:

    -   Applied clustering algorithms such as **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, or **DBSCAN** to segment customers into meaningful groups.

    -   Used dimensionality reduction techniques like **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to simplify the dataset and improve clustering performance.

4.  **Customer Segmentation**:

    -   Identified distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior, such as high spenders, frequent buyers, or occasional shoppers.

    -   Analyzed the characteristics of each segment to understand their preferences and behaviors.

5.  **Evaluation and Interpretation**:

    -   Evaluated the clustering results using metrics like **Silhouette Score** or **Elbow Method** to ensure optimal segmentation.

    -   Interpreted the clusters to derive actionable business insights, such as targeting specific segments with tailored marketing campaigns.

6.  **Applications**:

    -   The results of this project can be used to enhance customer retention, optimize marketing efforts, and improve overall customer satisfaction by delivering personalized experiences.

### Tools and Technologies Used:

-   **Programming Language**: Python

-   **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

-   **Algorithms**: K-Means, PCA, Hierarchical Clustering
### Results:

1. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Using unsupervised learning techniques, successfully segmented customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
   - Identified key customer clusters such as:
     - **High Spenders**: Customers with high transaction values but lower purchase frequency.
     - **Frequent Buyers**: Customers who make regular purchases with moderate spending.
     - **Occasional Shoppers**: Customers with infrequent purchases and lower spending.
     - **Seasonal Shoppers**: Customers who purchase during specific periods or promotions.

2. **Cluster Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the clustering performance using the **Silhouette Score** and **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Achieved a high Silhouette Score, indicating well-defined and distinct clusters.

3. **Insights Derived**:
   - **High Spenders**: Represent a small percentage of customers but contribute significantly to revenue. Targeted with premium offers and loyalty programs.
   - **Frequent Buyers**: Key to maintaining consistent revenue. Engaged with personalized recommendations and subscription-based models.
   - **Occasional Shoppers**: Potential for growth through targeted promotions and discounts to increase purchase frequency.
   - **Seasonal Shoppers**: Targeted during specific seasons or events with time-sensitive offers.

4. **Business Applications**:
   - Enabled data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies.
   - Improved customer retention and satisfaction through personalized engagement.
   - Optimized resource allocation by focusing on high-value customer segments.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - Created visual representations of customer clusters using **2D/3D scatter plots** (after PCA) to illustrate the separation and distribution of segments.
   - Generated heatmaps to highlight purchasing patterns and correlations between customer attributes.

### Conclusion:
The project successfully applied unsupervised learning techniques to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing and improved customer engagement. The results demonstrate the power of machine learning in transforming raw data into meaningful business strategies.
