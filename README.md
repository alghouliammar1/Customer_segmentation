### Results:

1. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Using unsupervised learning techniques, successfully segmented customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
   - Identified key customer clusters such as:
     - **High Spenders**: Customers with high transaction values but lower purchase frequency.
     - **Frequent Buyers**: Customers who make regular purchases with moderate spending.
     - **Occasional Shoppers**: Customers with infrequent purchases and lower spending.
     - **Seasonal Shoppers**: Customers who purchase during specific periods or promotions.

2. **Cluster Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the clustering performance using the **Silhouette Score** and **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Achieved a high Silhouette Score, indicating well-defined and distinct clusters.

3. **Insights Derived**:
   - **High Spenders**: Represent a small percentage of customers but contribute significantly to revenue. Targeted with premium offers and loyalty programs.
   - **Frequent Buyers**: Key to maintaining consistent revenue. Engaged with personalized recommendations and subscription-based models.
   - **Occasional Shoppers**: Potential for growth through targeted promotions and discounts to increase purchase frequency.
   - **Seasonal Shoppers**: Targeted during specific seasons or events with time-sensitive offers.

4. **Business Applications**:
   - Enabled data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies.
   - Improved customer retention and satisfaction through personalized engagement.
   - Optimized resource allocation by focusing on high-value customer segments.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - Created visual representations of customer clusters using **2D/3D scatter plots** (after PCA) to illustrate the separation and distribution of segments.
   - Generated heatmaps to highlight purchasing patterns and correlations between customer attributes.

### Conclusion:
The project successfully applied unsupervised learning techniques to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing and improved customer engagement. The results demonstrate the power of machine learning in transforming raw data into meaningful business strategies.
